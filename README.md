better way for coldfusion debug output
I thought the one for coldbox was really cool figured I would steal some ideas from it

Steps I have taken to use this template
  # find your current debug page, mine was under C:\ColdFusion8\wwwroot\WEB-INF    debug
  # checkout the coldfusion-debug project from github into that folder
  # go to coldfusion administrator and click on debug settings to change the debug to any of the other templates

enjoy

I'll try getting a few different varieties up on here

Note some people can't find there debug output area, so here is a list of possible locations
  * C:\JRun4\servers\cfusion\cfusion-ear\cfusion-war\WEB-INF
  * C:\ColdFusion8\wwwroot\WEB-INF
  * C:\ColdFusion9\wwwroot\WEB-INF\
  * C:\ColdFusion10\cfusion\wwwroot\WEB-INF\
  * C:\ColdFusion11\cfusion\wwwroot\WEB-INF\
